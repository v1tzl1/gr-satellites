    Corrects BPSK ambiguity by inverting the sign of the softbit for negative correlations.

    Copies the input softbits to the output stream. If a negative correlation is detected the
    sign of the softbits will be inverted (i.e. multiplied with -1) while copying them to the
    output.

    Positive or negative correlation is detected by looking for stream tags with the provided
    key and a float correlation value. If the sign of the float value is positive the softbits
    are left unchanged, while if the correlation is negative, the softbit signs will be inverted.

    Each output sample is treated according to the last received correlation tag (initially a
    positive correlation is assumed), regardless of how "old" the last correlation tag is.
